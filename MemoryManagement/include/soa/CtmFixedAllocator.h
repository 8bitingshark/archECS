	/// CtmFixedAllocator is a slightly modified version of 
	/// Alexandrescu’s FixedAllocator, designed to improve the speed 
	/// of allocation and deallocation, especially in butterfly 
	/// (sub)trend scenarios.
	/// 
	/// It uses std::deque to keep tracks of allocated chunks.
	/// - Insertion and deletion at either end of a deque never 
	///   invalidates pointers or references to the rest of the elements.
	/// - As opposed to std::vector, the elements of a deque are 
	///   not stored contiguously.
	/// - Expansion of a deque is cheaper than the expansion of 
	///   a std::vector because it does not involve copying of the 
	///   existing elements to a new memory location. On the other hand,
	///   deques typically have large minimal memory cost.
	/// (For more see:https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque.html).
	/// 
	/// Using std::deque in this context allows the allocator to safely use 
	/// an std::map for faster lookup of the appropriate chunk during deallocation,
	/// while avoiding pointer invalidation.
	/// 
	/// A separate std::vector is also maintained to cache empty chunks,
	/// and trying to speed up newer allocations.
	/// 
	/// Additionally, the m_numFullBlocks member tracks how many chunks 
	/// are completely full, allowing the allocator to skip unnecessary searches 
	/// for available chunks, unlike the original Alexandrescu implementation.
	/// 
	/// This approach trades some space for potential gains 
	/// in allocation and deallocation speed.
